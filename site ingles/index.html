      <h2>
        Come and discover a bit about the latest
        technologies!
      </h2>
      <p>
        At Unix, our goal is to transform the daily
        operations of hospitals, businesses, industries, and
        stores through the implementation of innovative
        solutions in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the
        Internet of Things (IoT). We believe technology has
        the power to optimize processes, save time, and
        improve efficiency across various sectors. Our
        commitment is to provide tools that automate routine
        and complex tasks, enabling employees and healthcare
        professionals to focus on what truly matters:
        delivering quality service and making strategic
        decisions. With our solutions, we aim to simplify
        daily tasks, reduce the burden of manual work, and
        minimize human errors. For hospitals, our
        technologies are designed to enhance hospital
        management, from patient monitoring to resource
        administration. This results in a more organized and
        efficient environment, where healthcare
        professionals can dedicate more time to patient
        care. In businesses and industries, our AI and IoT
        solutions help automate production processes,
        monitor equipment in real time, and predict
        necessary maintenance. This not only boosts
        productivity but also ensures a safer and more
        efficient work environment. At Unix, we are
        committed to bringing innovation and efficiency to
        all our partners, helping them achieve their goals
        with greater speed and precision.Join us on this
        journey toward a smarter and more automated future.

        <h2>Energy Monitoring Systems</h2>
        <br />
        <img

        <br />
        <p>
          Energy Monitoring Systems: These systems use IoT
          sensors to measure energy consumption in
          real-time, identifying equipment that consumes the
          most electricity and providing insights for
          reducing usage. In addition to lowering energy
          costs, they help decrease carbon emissions by
          optimizing the use of energy resources. In Brazil,
          the BNDES and ANEEL initiative in the "Smart City
          Búzios" project uses this technology to optimize
          energy consumption and reduce CO2 emissions.

        <br />
        <p>
          Waste Management with IoT: By utilizing sensors to
          monitor waste levels and collection processes,
          this system helps companies minimize improper
          disposal and optimize selective collection. With
          precise management, it becomes possible to reduce
          the amount of waste sent to landfills, promoting
          recycling and composting practices whenever
          possible. The Brazilian startup GreenPlat has
          developed a platform that leverages IoT to monitor
          waste management, fostering sustainability.

        <br />
        <p>
          Smart Pacemakers: Devices like those from
          Medtronic provide real-time monitoring of cardiac
          activity and transmit data to doctors, enabling
          adjustments to treatments for arrhythmias and
          other heart conditions without the need for
          frequent hospital visits. With remote monitoring
          capabilities, these devices reduce hospital visits
          and allow for real-time treatment adjustments,
          promoting preventive healthcare and optimizing
          medical resource usage

        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Omnipod System: Developed by Insulet, this system
          continuously monitors glucose levels and
          administers insulin as needed. It’s an innovative
          solution for diabetes care, minimizing the need
          for manual dosage adjustments. This automated
          insulin delivery system also reduces reliance on
          disposable syringes and needles, while improving
          glycemic control. Better glucose management can
          help lower the risk of hospitalizations and
          additional treatments for diabetes-related
          complications.

        <br />
        <p>
          Smart Prosthetics: Connected prosthetics, such as
          those by Össur, use sensors to automatically
          adjust based on the user’s activity. They enhance
          mobility and comfort, providing a more natural
          experience for amputees. By adapting automatically
          to the user, these prosthetics reduce the need for
          frequent check-ups and manual adjustments, saving
          resources. Additionally, they improve the user’s
          quality of life, potentially reducing reliance on
          additional treatments.
